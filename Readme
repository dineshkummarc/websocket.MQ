websocket.MQ

https://github.com/networkimprov/websocket.MQ

A reliable message queue service for websocket-connected clients.
The initial goal is to enable messaging among Node.js instances on the public net.

As with email, each message is posted with a list of recipients. We don't track subscriptions.
On disk, messages are stored in separate files, within transient directories for each recipient.

Message format
  f0f {"op":"type" ...}data
  1-4 hex digits, padded with 0-3 spaces, giving the size of the JSON metadata object
  JSON metadata
  arbitrary size data

Message op types
  To server: register, login, post, ack
  To client: info, quit, deliver, ack

Dependencies:
  Node.js 0.2.x https://github.com/ry/node
  Bundled:
    node-websocket-server https://github.com/miksago/node-websocket-server

Roadmap:
  Node- & browser-compatible client library
  SSL
  Email gateway with SMTP client and LMTP server
  Modulize to enable access via socket.IO, etc
